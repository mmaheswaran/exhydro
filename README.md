# Exhydro 

## An *ex*tensible *hydro*dynamics code

A work in progress, but below is the plan.  The code aspires to be as extensible as possible.

![This is a alt text.](/images/mindmap.png "Code structure and plan.")

Things to be done:

* Time integration and solving the equations for momentum and energy
* Artificial viscosity or Riemann solver for managing shocks
* Input deck reading
* Mesh objects
	* volume fraction
	* material number

Wish list:

* Parallel/GPU capability
* HDF5 read/write capability
* Integration of yaml for input parsing
